ScreenSharing
=============

A C# program based on client-server architecture to connect multiple users.
The server can share its screen (it is possible to share only a specific window, the entire desktop or only a specific part of screen), and all the users can communicate each other sending chat messages.
It is also possible to exchange the clipboard data (file, image or text) with other users.
